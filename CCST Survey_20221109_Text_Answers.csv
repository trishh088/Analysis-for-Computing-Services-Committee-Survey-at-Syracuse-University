Also, the IT Procurement Process has to be better balanced regarding accessibility.

Again, my recommendation is to use MySlice additions to replace forms when possible, and if that isn't always possible, to have knowledgeable form creators that any office can work with to create a more user friendly form.

Creating an *automatically populated* Blackboard organization for each academic program (or at a request of such a program) would be a solution.

While I understand the value and need for security, there are several areas where it has felt like we are playing ""catch-up"" and have quickly implemented solutions without a full scope of impact. 
One main area of concern is the ability to automate using non-user based accounts. I hope we can look at more modern ways of granting server/system level access like implementing more role based permissioning and an option for service account functionality without having to grant full access to tools to assist with blast radius.",No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,I have work closely with the syracuse.edu Digital team. We know navigation and content is currently an issue with all SU properties and overhaul initiatives are currently underway to optimize. ,Somewhat disagree,Disagree,Strongly agree,,"I understand and overall support the need for an accessibility policy, though I find the policy to be very limiting and inconsistently applied.

The policy is another area where I feel something was implemented very hastily and the impact on not being able to obtain certain business tools solely due to not being accessible, causes more work for persons needing those tools because accessible tools may not exist, or may exist without the features that improve the optimization of jobs.

The policy also looks at tools in a very ""black/white"" way, meaning there is minimal to no gray allowed. Many times these tools would meet some minimal accessibility requirements that would satisfy most general accommodations needed by users within a unit, but are not an option based on the policy.
I think there needs to be an evaluation to apply varying levels of the accessibility policy based more on usage and size within a unit, especially non-academic ones where the need for accommodations is both more known and controllable.

WCAG is still a new concept for many web-based tools and our policy tries to apply too strict of a requirement at too broad of an application in attempt to account for every case of an accommodation.

Outside of procurement, there is minimal global enforcement of the policy, leaving many areas improperly accessible - meaning they might check a box in a checker, but do not actually meet accessibility standards. 

While the policy promotes accessibility, it does not promote true equity or universal design, which should be the standard.

It also does not account for accessibility of information across multiple channels (print, signage, digital signage, website) . In many areas, we are forcing accessible PDFs of printed documents that in many cases live as a web native entity or should be promoted as the accessible alternative for documents or printed materials. The experience to a person needing to rely on accommodations is actually worsened by the requirement of the policy to apply to every channel. A web/digital first channel would serve as an enhanced experience had there not been a requirement an accessible companion document. 
","Overall, things are generally maintained well and work, but it feels we are behind many other higher ed peers and most corporate organizations. There are a lot of more modern ways of doing things and opportunities to stop manual process or remove roadblocks or speedbumps. ","There is not a robust enough Enterprise Application unit in ITS. In 2022, it is expected by staff, (newer) faculty, and students that tools serve a variety of use cases within multiple units be integrated and maintained in a more central fashion.
Many times at SU, because agreements over distributed funding cannot be secured, tools are not implemented at a more enterprise scale. This forces each unit to find individualized solutions, even if solving the same problems, and creates user confusion and lack of cross integration as well as limited access to data when implemented in siloed areas. 
","Lack of central and modern big data practices and access.
Relying on manual SQL data pulls and emailed csv files for lists of information is both a very old method as well as a major security vulnerability.

There are many more modern ways of allowing more real-time access to data streams while increasing the security all while better controlling visibility and access.","Administrative units are ""second-class"" to academic ones. Rules/policies that are put in place to benefit Academic Units are typically applied to administrative units with much different needs.
There needs to be a more defined central Administrative and Academic business use applied to the management of ITS resources and policies."

Then any affected areas should be notified of the project and invited to meeting to let the lead area know of any issue that could pop up in their area by said project.  At Syracuse University, a constant problem is one hand not knowing what the other hand is doing.

BlackBoard is very clunky and old-school and makes more work for students and professors.

For instance, why can't students upload ""Pages"" documents or google docs on BlackBoard that I can then grade 'in-line?' Why does it all have to be Word or pdf?

I keep software up-to-date with the most recent versions and security updates. I do this because I spend most of my day on my computer and I want it to function exactly the way I want it to. Not having adminstrative control over my computer is a constant source of frustration, as are the various changes that ITS makes to the computer, and the software and profiles they install. To put things bluntly, in the past 15 years, I have never had a computer that I purchased myself and that I had any problems with that I couldn't solve myself. In contrast, I have never had a computer that I purchased through ITS that I did not have problems with. Given that I spend much of my work day in front of a computer, this is a source of near constant frustration. And I believe the security-related justifications for this are misguided.","Technical support though ITS is very slow. Perhaps the support team is understaffed, but this is not the impression that one gets when one visits the office in person. When faculty have a serious problem with a computer, it is usually a show-stopper, something that prevents them from doing their job. Too often, the solution is to drop off a laptop for a day or more. This is just not a workable situation. Problems need to be solved much more quickly. This is one reason I am very reluctant to go to ITS with any problems. It is another reason it would be very helpful to have full administrative access over my computer.

We have neither the financial resources nor the organizational capacity to expand our offering, and so it is also frustrating to us that no other solutions exist on campus for these students. We end up as a complaint center simply because we have attempted to create some sort of solution where nobody else has. This has been further complicated by a recent trend of Faculty requesting these machines for similar reasons and expecting that we not only prioritize their requests but also waive the fee that we charge for the service. My understanding is that individual colleges' ITS departments should have solutions for Faculty, but the Faculty seem entirely unaware.

For example, the very limited approach to email where SU has essentially enabled Microsoft to dictate what is an acceptable email client is greatly frustrating. This is not an issue of my willingness to learn a new client. It takes a considerable amount of time and effort dealing with email each day; why am I forced to use a client that does not fit with my workflow, which I have spent years tweaking and optimizing? There are open standards that could be embraced. Please enable IMAP and/or POP support.","Though many SAS services are much easier to deploy, I do not think the campus has serious confronted issues of security, privacy, or the relationships these imposes upon university members. Why is my work as a teacher contingent upon a relationship to Microsoft? I do not appreciate all the social media aspects that Microsoft grafts onto basic tasks such as email, file sharing, calendaring, video conferencing, etc. I further do not appreciate that they extract value from me (in the training of AI algorithms) while I have no way to opt out. Similarly, with Zoom, which runs facial recognition algorithms on video calls. (Microsoft is likely doing similar with Teams.) We have no idea the consequences for this in the near- or long-term future---both for Americans, but also for international faculty and students. I find it troubling that SU does not take these issues seriously. I would love it if the university embraced the hosting of more services on site and, even more so, if those services were opensource.","Please, please do not force me to watch any inane videos as part of ""training.""

I somewhat wonder if having a central office or person to do these adjustments (such as .pdf corrections) would be useful, given that there is a great deal of nuance. I realize that's quite costly (and presumes faculty are planning enough in advance), but it's a struggle ... especially when so many of our ""older"" documents fail these checks but do not seem to be correctable (at least, in my skill set).

The best solution that I've found is to self-host a whiteboard server for a particular pen annotation app that I use (""write"" by styluslabs), which I have to host from my personal computer at home since my remote collaborators can't connect to a computer internal to the syracuse network.

Tools like 25live for facility approval are currently managed by the registrar.  This leads to them not having much bandwidth to roll out new features and expand overall campus use.  The overhead of managing the security in that application is too much for a single user and would be better off in a properly resourced central group.  We then have a central marketing calendar, that doesn't tie to the facility resource booking (25live) at all - which creates just an additional headache and a place to update if there is a room change or last-minute update to an event. 


The same is true for any applications that are used by many but then run by a unit.   The four winds digital signage solution is administered by the ischool, which currently works fine, but doenst seem very fair.  I believe we could do a better job managing the workflow of how units promote material to digital signage campus wide. ","Losing institutional knowledge by not paying market price for technologists.

Between February 2021 and November 2021 - Whitman lost 5 IT FTE with a combined 25+years of Syracuse University / Whitman School of Management institutional knowledge.   The hiring process takes WAY too long and is full of issues.   Sometimes posting the same job, with the same description would take over 4-6 weeks.  In the private sector, this is usually done a day or two after someone gives notice of resignation.   Most of these employees went on to do a similar role/job with a 50% increase in salary.   Some of these employees doubled their salaries. 

The university also has a desire to custom-build tools, which are usually great short-term on the wallet.  But they are often open-sourced tools, that require a developer or team of developers to understand and architect and maintain.   The cost is in the maintenance of these tools.  We then let the employee who architected the tools leave the university because they are not being appropriately compensated.   Then you realize when you post a job with a low salary, that no one is interested in taking a 30% cut from what they can make outside the university just to work at the university.   

The on-ramp to SU IT is very long for both reasons above.   We don't pay enough to get people to hit the ground running when they start, so you need to hire someone green and hope they have a good ability to learn via training and certifications.  We also do things in such a unique way in regards to building computers and deploying software via command line scripting tools that most candidates have never seen or done things in such a way.   ","Everyone feels under-resourced, and they are. The only way to fix this issue is to heavily invest in the people and systems that SU uses.   Some roles require very high salaries to get projects done - that is normal.  We should try to retain good talent.  Sometimes this means we need to entertain real remote or hybrid work.   We need systems that help manage that new type of employee.

Even those without work issued laptops who have MS MFA on their machines find it frustrating. That coupled with a regularly-changed password create probably 75% of the tech problems we have at Project Advance, as they go to login to Myslice, PASS or Blackboard after some time and they no longer have access.

Lately there has even been a ""trying to connect"" message when I'm just downloading or uploading an attachment in Outlook, and I'm left clueless as to why.

Let's try to overcome that here at SU.","Administrative tools like reporting, Tableau, analytics, dashboards, Azure Cognitive Services and RPA could dramatically assist in our work, but yet even though our students are learning these tools, we as staff and faculty are very restricted in using them for administrative purposes.

When Word, Excel and PowerPoint came into the world's office, the goal was to democratize the tools so we could all be more productive.  I think we've done that with those, but it doesn't seem like we're keeping up with the newer tools and productivity suites.  An investment in tools for us and training to use them would go much further than trying to restrict tools to only what ITS can support, and only training ITS staff to support them.  I think we're beyond that as users at SU, but we aren't truly respected for that evolution.  "

Students cannot install software images or environments on classroom computers (we're blocked from doing so). Most instructors I know who teach computational programming insist that students bring their own computers to class. Since software environments are operating system dependent, it can take instructors substantial time to create a packaged environment that will work on all student personal computers.

","Interfacing with external networks to access computing resources and move data.We don’t have a VPN client, we use the remote desktop service provided by SU (https://rds.syr.edu/rdweb/webclient/). Connecting to external networks involves remote desktopping into a generic computer at SU and then establishing a connection to the external network (or SU research computing allocation); a process called “double jumping.” This is not user friendly: the system can experience lags, you can only view the remote resource using a web browser, copy and paste operations aren’t available. It’s making graduate students crazy.

Staff who are trying to answer questions from students/parents calling in or trying to complete tasks on deadline during registration should not have to wait through several minutes of the 'spinning wheel' while the system comes to grips with the number of users logged on simultaneously.
My second biggest complaint is that MySlice pop-ups are often incompatible with Chrome or Safari, particularly when it involves being directed to a payment site. It is not pleasant to field calls from students/parents who are angry that they cannot use their preferred browser.
My third complaint is that I find the 'tiles' redesign of MySlice to be awkward because it can take a moment to find certain functions, especially when they're located under a tile that seems counterintuitive. It would also be helpful if there were thorough staff and student MySlice tile guides published on the ITS site, because students often ask staff in my office where to find certain functions.

The most important one is that accessing it is extremely slow. It is probably the slowest website I have accessed in quite some time, including websites that get significantly more traffic than Syracuse. There’s no reason for it to be that slow, I have no idea why it’s that slow.

The more important problem is that it seems to be very difficult to change the information on the websites regarding my department. There’s incorrect information on the websites. Staff have contacted people to update things and it never happens. Finally I had to step in to do it myself but I still haven’t actually succeeded. There are programs listed that are no longer offered and it is extremely confusing to prospective students and I believe it hurts our recruitment. In addition the process for making changes to the website is insane. Apparently I have to copy and paste the website I want to change into a word document make the changes with track changes and then send it back. This is profoundly time consuming.

My opinion is that mandatory protocol should be to make sure that Orange Tracker sends an email to the requester at every step.

Instead of coming together to say: ""okay, we did what we could with what we had in the past and now going forward we see that we can make improvements in these areas."" SU leadership was content to keep things as close to what wasn't working in the past and continued to jam through old ideas, thoughts, and pathways.

You have an insanely talented collection of people who have worked at SU for DECADES. With this comes a wealth of knowledge. That combined with ""what would it look like if things were working flawlessly"" and you could come together to find proactive solutions. ","Redundancy. Why do we have four platforms that can control video conferencing? How is it a smart idea to support three different data science and reporting platforms? 

Redundancy in the tech world is invaluable in some areas (like data protection/duplication) but by just turning on so many products and letting the community do whatever they want with whatever tools that choose, cripples the ability to support users. 

How do you become an expert in Teams and Zoom and Collaborate and Hangout and Kaltura all at the same time? How does SU have all this funding to pay for FOUR platforms that do the same thing? Why not choose to fully invest into one that will be expertly supported instead of many that are half-assed supported?

Departments are not encouraged to work with each other in a collaborative way with these things. If anything, they are encouraged to just stand up the product quickly so they can reactively fix whatever some higher up thinks is important to change. 

Painting over layers of wallpaper instead of eventually just getting back to drywall and doing it right, will eventually come to bite someone in the butt. Just never the right people. It comes back to bite those on the front lines trying to help.

LISTEN to your front-line people. Stop allowing people in rooms to make decisions if they are not actually interacting with the population. ""Your friend's daughter that goes to Newhouse said maybe they heard we should use Zoom"" is not a reason to just buy it without a review of what we have already paid for.

SU loves to play both cards. We are strong in wealth and drive while simultaneously having no money to do X or Y or Z and needing to do what we can with the resources we have.
